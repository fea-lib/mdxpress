# 📝 Amelcraft: A Kid-Friendly 2D Minecraft-Inspired Game

## 🔄 Project Evolution
The project began as a birthday idea for a 7-year-old, inspired by the Minecraft hype but aiming for simplicity and accessibility. The concept evolved from a general 2D block-building game to a focused, responsive, cross-device experience using Phaser.js. Early discussions weighed complexity (e.g., day/night cycles, pathfinding) against the need for a fun, easy-to-play game. The design journey included debates about control schemes, building mechanics, and the choice between 2D and simulated 3D, ultimately favoring a top-down, grid-based approach for ease of use and development.

## 🚀 Project Genesis & Motivation
The motivation was personal: to create a custom game for a child’s birthday, capturing the excitement of Minecraft in a form approachable for a young beginner. The project was inspired by the child’s fascination with Minecraft and the desire to provide a creative, interactive experience tailored to her age and skills. The goal was to foster creativity, exploration, and fun, while keeping technical and gameplay complexity low.

## 🚀 Project Overview
Amelcraft is a simple, 2D, tile-based game where players can harvest materials and place blocks in a world reminiscent of Minecraft. Designed for both desktop and mobile, it features responsive controls and adaptive camera zoom, ensuring a smooth experience across devices. The game is intended for young children, with intuitive drag-to-move controls and straightforward block placement.

## 💡 Core Ideas & Features
- **2D Tile-Based World:** The game world is a grid of 48x48px tiles.
- **Harvesting & Placing Blocks:** Players collect materials and place blocks on the grid.
- **Drag-to-Move Controls:** Movement is controlled by dragging on the screen (touch or mouse).
- **Responsive Design:** The game adapts to device size and orientation, with dynamic camera zoom.
- **Simple Inventory:** Materials collected are stored and can be selected for placement.
- **Single-File POC:** Initial proof-of-concept provided as a single HTML file for easy testing.

## 🧩 Design Decisions & Rationale
- **Phaser.js Chosen:** For rapid development and cross-platform support.
- **Drag-to-Move Over Click-to-Move:** Simpler for young children, avoids pathfinding complexity.
- **Top-Down (Horizontal) Building:** More intuitive for kids, easier to implement than vertical or 3D.
- **Responsive Canvas & Camera Zoom:** Ensures playability on all devices, keeps sprites visible and detailed.
- **No Day/Night Cycle:** Dropped for simplicity.
- **Block Placement Logic:** Grid-based, with pointer-to-tile conversion for intuitive interaction.

## ❌ Rejected Ideas & Alternatives
- **Day/Night Cycle:** Rejected to keep the game simple.
- **Click-to-Move with Pathfinding:** Considered but dropped due to complexity.
- **3D or Isometric Building:** Rejected for technical and cognitive simplicity; 2D chosen.
- **Vertical (Wall) Building:** Considered, but horizontal (ground) building selected for accessibility.

## ⚖️ Player vs. Team Focus Debate
The game is designed as a single-player experience, focused on individual creativity and exploration. Team or multiplayer features were not prioritized, given the target audience and scope.

## 🌏 Personal/Inspirational Details
The project was inspired by a child’s birthday and her fascination with Minecraft. The design choices reflect a desire to create a fun, approachable experience tailored to her interests and abilities.

## 💬 Key Conversation Excerpts
> “For my daughter's 7th birthday I want to make her a little video game, using phaser.js...simple 2D, sprite and tilemap based game, in which she can harvest a few materials and then place blocks from these materials in the world.”

> “I want the game to run on a desktop, as well as a mobile phone...controllable by touch/mouse click and the game screen and camera zoom level should adapt itself to the device.”

> “For simplicity and a smooth experience for a 7-year-old, Option 2 (drag-to-move) is best. It’s easy to implement in Phaser, and kids enjoy direct control.”

> “For a Minecraft-like experience and simplicity for a child, the horizontal plane (top-down) is best. It’s intuitive, easy to control, and lets your daughter ‘walk’ over her creations.”

## 🏗️ Architecture & Structure
- **Phaser.js Engine:** Handles rendering, input, and game logic.
- **Responsive Canvas:** Uses Phaser’s scale manager for device adaptation.
- **Camera Zoom Logic:** Dynamically calculates zoom based on screen size and tile size.
- **Player Sprite:** Controlled via drag-to-move pointer events.
- **Tile Grid:** 2D array represents the world; block placement updates the grid and renders sprites.
- **Inventory System:** Simple array for collected materials and block selection.
